        Hi there! I'm Austin French and I'm a web developer. I've spent the past
        year delving into programming and computer science, and for two years
        prior to that I spent my time as a player and coach in eSports. I'm
        currently a Project Manager at Lambda School, but I'm looking to line up
        opportunities to pursue after I complete my contract in August.
      </p>

        I'm a huge fan of JavaScript (especially React and Node), but naturally
        I've found myself using all of the following technologies in my
        experience as well:
      </p>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML/CSS</li>
          <li>Git</li>
          <li>jQuery</li>
          <li>python</li>
          <li>Django</li>
          <li>C</li>
          <li>C++ (UE4)</li>
          <li>C# (Unity)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        I'm a hard worker and I have an insatiable desire to learn. If you would
        like to learn more about me, check out my <a href="/blog">blog</a> where
        I talk about projects I've worked on and my experience in software
        development and eSports. If you'd like to contact me in regards to an
        employment opportunity, check out my <a href="/contact">contact</a>{' '}
